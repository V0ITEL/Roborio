  "viewAllFaqs": "View all FAQs ->",
  "faq1Q": "What is Roborio?",
  "faq1A": "Roborio is a decentralized marketplace built on Solana where businesses can rent robots on-demand. Think of it as \"Uber for robots\" - operators list their robots, businesses rent them for specific tasks, and payments are handled automatically via smart contracts.",
  "faq2Q": "How do payments work?",
  "faq2A": "For MVP pilots, payments are coordinated directly with verified operators after you reserve a slot. Escrow automation is planned for later phases as we expand the marketplace.",
  "faq3Q": "What types of robots are available?",
  "faq3A": "Our marketplace features delivery robots, cleaning bots, security patrol units, inspection drones, warehouse automation, agricultural robots, and healthcare assistants. New categories are added as operators join the platform.",
  "faq4Q": "How do I become a robot operator?",
  "faq4A": "Robot owners can list their units on Roborio, set their own pricing, and earn $ROBORIO for completed tasks. Our platform handles booking, payments, and dispute resolution. Staking $ROBORIO tokens gives operators priority listing.",
  "faq5Q": "What is $ROBORIO token used for?",
  "faq5A": "$ROBORIO will power discounts, staking, and governance once the token is live. The MVP demo focuses on marketplace flow and operator trust while token utilities roll out.",
  "faq6Q": "When will the marketplace launch?",
  "faq6A": "The MVP demo is live today, and we're onboarding pilot customers now. Join the waitlist to secure early access and priority reservations.",
  "faq7Q": "How does Roborio ensure quality?",
  "faq7A": "Every operator is vetted and each robot is reviewed before it appears in the demo. We also collect post-pilot feedback to keep only top-performing operators.",
  "faq8Q": "Is there an API for businesses?",
  "faq8A": "Yes, our REST API allows businesses to integrate robot rentals directly into their operations. Schedule recurring tasks, manage fleets, track robots in real-time, and automate payments - all programmatically.",
